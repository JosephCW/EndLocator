Minecraft End Locator

Quick little program to help you find the end in your game. All you need to have is 2 eyes of ender.

This program was designed based off of this page [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/survival-mode/289172-how-to-find-a-stronghold-only-two-eyes-of-ender). Also a very simple image explaining it [here](http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/3579/trough3.png).
