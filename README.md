Minecraft End Locator

Quick little program to help you find the end in your game. All you need to have is 2 eyes of ender. This program is based off of point slope form and finding the intersection of two linear lines. see (http://zonalandeducation.com/mmts/intersections/intersectionOfTwoLines1/intersectionOfTwoLines1.html)
